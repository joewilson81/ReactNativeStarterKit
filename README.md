# React Native Starter Kit

## Part I: I should have picked a better name

I found a few starter kits online, but they were almost all using an older version of React Native. I felt it was better to list the steps to get my ideal baseline React Native app up and running with the latest versions.

Although I named this project ReactNativeStarterKit, it is more of a list of steps to take rather than an actual starter kit that should be cloned.

## Part II: Requirements

If you have already set up React Native, skip to Part III.

I'm not going to recreate the steps to set up React Native, so head on over to [their site to get set up](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).

## Part III: Commands to get this app up and running

1. Initialize a new React Native project: `react-native init ReactNativeStarterKit`

2. I'm assuming we're going to use Redux, so let's install it: `npm i redux --save`

   We also need React-Redux: `npm i react-redux --save`
